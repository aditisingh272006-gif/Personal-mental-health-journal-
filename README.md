This project is a beginner-friendly Python application that suggests outfits based on the type of weather. The user selects the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold, or cloudy), and the program recommends a suitable outfit. The logic is built using simple conditional statements, making it easy to understand yet effective.
